      <p className="about-content">
        Hello, I am Omor Faruk. I received my education in a Madrasa, where
        emphasis was placed on Islamic education. Despite my academic focus on
        religious studies, my passion for programming was immense. After
        completing my studies in the Madrasa, my interest in programming led me
        to start learning online.
      </p>
      <p className="about-content">
        I delved into documentation and watched tutorials on YouTube to
        kickstart my programming journey. I started with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. As I progressed, my curiosity and love for programming grew.
        Now, I proudly identify myself as a Front-end Developer.
      </p>
      <p className="about-content">
        My current skill set includes expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        React. This journey, transitioning from a Madrasa background to becoming
        a Front-end Developer, is a testament to my dedication and enthusiasm
        for programming.

        Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey and projects!
